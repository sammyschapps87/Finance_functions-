    "We are evaluating a project that costs $845,000, has an eight-year life, and has no salvage value. Assume that depreciation is straight-line to zero over the life of the project. Sales are projected at 51,000 units per year. Price per unit is $53, variable cost per unit is $27, and fixed costs are $950,000 per year. The tax rate is 22 percent, and we require a return of 10 percent on this project. \n",
